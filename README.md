# Social Network Graphs
A program that is able to both analyze and visualize a medium-sized network graph. 

### References
The important references for this practice are:

* [Social Networks](http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~gawron/python_for_ss/course_core/book_draft/Social_Networks/Social_Networks.html) is a textbook chapter on studying social networks as graphs. It gives clear, readable explanations of most of the graph concepts you'll be studying.
* [NetworkX](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/networkx-1.11/) the graph library you'll be using.
* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) the plotting library you'll be using ([full api reference](https://plot.ly/python/reference/)).

Also remember to answer the questions about the combined network in the `SUBMISSION.md` file!
