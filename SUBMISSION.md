# Social Network Graphs

The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

##### Consider the number of connected components reported by your analysis program. Based on the visual representation, are their fairly obvious communities within the network? Are there people who act as "bridges" between communities? Explain #####
> Yes, there are obvious 5 clusters like communities within the network. And yes, there are people brdige communities. For instance, node 175 is a "bridge" connecting different communities.


##### Does the compiled Facebook graph represent a "small world"? Explain your answer. #####
> According to Watts and Strogatz, a network with a low Average Path Length (APL) and a high Clustering Coefficient (CC) is called a small world. In the graph, the big nodes represent the high CC, and obviously the APL is low. So I consider this graph represents a small world.
